          <h3 id="chicken" class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
          <p>
            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising
            chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and
            chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines. <br>
            <br>
            Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and
            boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food.
            Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol
            and saturated fat. <br>
            <br>
            The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different
            parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods
            while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations
            estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
            <br>
            <br>
            Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when
            measured as weight percentage. <br>
            <br>
            Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly
            concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of
            protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt
            steak. <br>
            <br>
            Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department
            of Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.
            However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken
            served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the
            inside remains raw. <br>
            <br>
            Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally
            grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant
            variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking,
            broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as
            fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads
            or tacos. <br>
            <br>
            Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of
            chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked
            with other methods. <br>
            <br>
            Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib meat". This is
            a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the
            breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true
            rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example.
            Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often,
            the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US,
            "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor
            are called "chicken mini-fillets". <br>
            <br>
            Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be
            simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock. <br>
            <br>
            In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups,
            which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have
            been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or
            "chicken carcasses" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.

          <h3 id="beef" class="text-center">Beef</h3>
          <p>
            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. <br> <br>

            In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since then, numerous breeds of
            cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most
            widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China
            were the largest producers of beef. In the United States, beef production has come to rely heavily on
            factory farms. The prevalence of manure in these farms has been linked to contamination of beef with E.
            coli, leading to large recalls, as well as increased antibiotic usage. The now-restricted use of meat and
            bone meal feed was historically responsible for outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow
            disease"). <br> <br>

            Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees
            of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein,
            iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased
            risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high
            environmental impact, with the highest per gram greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.
            Requiring high land use, it is the primary driver of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, with
            approximately 80% of deforested land used for beef production. <br> <br>

            People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave paintings,
            such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes.[6] People domesticated cattle to provide ready
            access to beef, milk, and leather. Cattle have been domesticated at least twice over the course of
            evolutionary history. The first domestication event occurred around 10,500 years ago with the evolution of
            Bos taurus. The second was more recent, around 7,000 years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the
            Indus Valley. There is a possible third domestication even 8,500 years ago, with a potential third species
            Bos africanus arising in Africa. Most cattle originated in the Old World, with the exception of bison
            hybrids, which originated in the Americas. Examples include the Wagyu from Japan, Ankole-Watusi from Egypt,
            and longhorn Zebu from the Indian subcontinent. <br> <br>

            It is unknown exactly when people started cooking beef. Cattle were widely used across the Old World as
            draft animals (oxen), for milk, or specifically for human consumption. With the mechanization of farming,
            some breeds were specifically bred to increase meat yield, resulting in Chianina and Charolais cattle, or to
            improve the texture of meat, giving rise to the Murray Grey, Angus, and Wagyu. Some breeds have been
            selected for both meat and milk production, such as the Brown Swiss (Braunvieh). <br> <br>

            In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest. Upon
            the acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican-American War of 1848, and later the expulsion of the
            Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began, starting primarily
            with the taming of wild longhorn cattle. Chicago and New York City were the first to benefit from these
            developments in their stockyards and in their meat markets. <br> <br>

          <h3 id="sushi" class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
          <p>
            Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
            accompanied by a variety of ingredients (neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi
            and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or
            sumeshi. <br><br>

            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
            short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
            imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari),
            wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. <br><br>

            Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced
            raw fish or occasionally meat. <br><br>

            The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the
            Western world, but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon. Historically, the
            Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon in nature often contains parasites and
            must be cooked or cured for its lean meat to be edible - therefore, unsuitable as raw meat. On the other
            side of the world, in the 60s and 70s, Norwegian entrepreneurs started experimenting with Aquaculture
            farming. The big breakthrough was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea. Being
            farm raised, the Atlantic salmon showed advantages over the Pacific salmon, such as no parasites, easy
            animal capture and could be grown with higher fat content. With government subsidies and improved
            techniques, they were so successful in raising fatty and parasite-free salmon, they ended up with a surplus.
            The country of Norway has a small population and limited market, therefore they looked to other countries to
            export their salmon, though the first Norwegian salmon was imported into Japan in 1980, it was accepted in
            the conventional way, for grilling, and not for sushi. At this point, Salmon has already been consumed in
            North America under the form of sushi as early as the 70s. Salmon sushi did not become widely accepted in
            Japan until a successful marketing partnership in the late 1980s between a Norwegian businessman tasked with
            helping the Norwegian salmon industry and the Japanese food supplier Nichirei. Creations to suit the Western
            palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a norimaki with crab (later, imitation
            crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) has evolved since.
            Norway roll is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber,
            rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and
            mayonnaise. <br><br>
